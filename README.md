# imgMilkyWay
imgMilkyWay is a openFrameworks project that takes an image as an input & processes it to a mesh which then can be manipulated in different visual (for now) ways.  
Saves the manipulated & drawn mesh as a img file, currently in 5000x5000 but should work up to whatever your graphics card is capabale of.

todo:
- LESS MESS!
- choose fileFormat ✓
- choose size of output ✓
- more fancy pancy visual stuff
- check lighting - seems like theres a problem
- Free camera movement ✓
- automated camera movement & automated framesaving. ffmpeg will do the rest (maybe threaded?)
